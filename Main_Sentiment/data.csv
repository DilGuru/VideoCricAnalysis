1,0,1,652.48,669.96,Morkel,Pandey,1,****leans forward to caress the full length delivery moving away from him to left of mid-off for a single
,,,,,,,,
1,0,2,699.24,710.08,Morkel,Kallis,0,"around the off stump, on a length, Kallis gets close to the line of bull and pushes it out to the off side"
,,,,,,,,
1,0,3,730.96,746.8,Morkel,Kallis,0,"**drama** Huge appeal for a catch behind but Russel Tiffin has turned it down. Lovely delivery, straightening from the good length, Kallis goes for the on-the-up off drive and the ball flies past the edge. Was there a nick? The replays don't confirm it. There was some itsy bitsy tiny noise on it. The appeal was unanimous but then these days that doesn't mean much."
,,,,,,,,
1,0,4,793.52,800.72,Morkel,Kallis,0,leans forward to push the length delivery to the off side
,,,,,,,,
1,0,5,834.84,854.2,Morkel,Kallis,1,shuffles across to push to mid-on for a single
,,,,,,,,
1,0,6,874.8,893.96,Morkel,Pandey,0,"fullish and around the legs, rolls of the pad"
,,,,,,,,
1,1,1,954.96,969.68,Tyagi,Kallis,1,"short in length and outside off stump, slashed away to third man"
,,,,,,,,
1,1,2,1001.04,1015.72,Tyagi,Pandey,4,"goes for the yorker, Manish takes his front leg out of the way and brings his bat down in a hurry. The ball flies off the inner half of the bat and rushes on this fast outfield to fine-leg boundary"
,,,,,,,,
1,1,3,1043.28,1056.96,Tyagi,Pandey,0,"length delivery around off , Manish stays beside the line to push it out to cover"
,,,,,,,,
1,1,4,1077.44,1083.76,Tyagi,Pandey,0,stays on the leg stump line and has a flash at a back-of-length delivery outside off stump but makes no contact . the bat goes under the ball
,,,,,,,,
1,1,5,1108.4,1119.68,Tyagi,Pandey,1,jumps to get on top of the bounce of the short-of- length delivery coming in to the middle stump line and works it to the leg for a single
,,,,,,,,
1,1,6,1143.52,1149.28,Tyagi,Kallis,0,"straightens around the middle stump line, Kallis was on the shuffle, adjusts his wrists to adjust to the straightening and pushes the ball to the on side of the pitch"
,,,,,,,,
1,2,1,1187.56,1202.6,Morkel,Pandey,1,"The bouncer arrives and Manish top-edges the pull. But luckily, for him , the ball lands safely in short fine-leg region"
,,,,,,,,
1,2,2,1222.72,1237.16,Morkel,Kallis,4,** L Bala** doesn't see the ball at third man! Opportunity for **catch missed**. Kallis had backed away and charged out for the big lofted off drive and ended up slicing the ball towards third man. Bala came forward and completely lost sight of the ball. Could be the crowd. Hopefully not his eyes. The ball sails over him and lands inside the boundary ropes!
,,,,,,,,
1,2,3,1278.56,1288.92,Morkel,Kallis,4,"Ooh . this pitch has bounce and carry. It kicks up from short of length, Kallis is almost squared-up as the ball straightens and manages to stab it just past the diving slip fielder and it races away"
,,,,,,,,
1,2,4,1321.76,1331.2,Morkel,Kallis,0,"in the zone outside off stump, left alone"
,,,,,,,,
1,2,5,1362.92,1377.2,Morkel,Kallis,0,charges out as he moves outside leg stump and tries to slash the bouncing short of length delivery but the ball bounces over the flashing blade.
,,,,,,,,
1,2,6,1398.24,1407.6,Morkel,Kallis,0,"fuller, around the off stump, hint of away movement, Kallis stays where he is this time and opens the bat-face to guide the ball to point"
,,,,,,,,
1,3,1,1450.2,1457.56,Tyagi,Pandey,0,"length delivery that moves in to off and middle, pushed out cautiously to the off side"
,,,,,,,,
1,3,2,1486.76,1497.56,Tyagi,Pandey,0,"backs away outside leg stump, Tyagi digs it in short and outside off, Manish tries to reach out but mistimes the intended cut and the ball rolls to cover"
,,,,,,,,
1,3,3,1522.8,1528.04,Tyagi,Pandey,0,And again. Another mistimed cut and this time the ball rolls off the bottom of the bat to slip.
,,,,,,,,
1,3,4,1550.92,1560.72,Tyagi,Pandey,0,"this one flies from short of length and Pandey again can't connect with the cut. Again, the bat went below the ball. Beaten by the extra bounce."
,,,,,,,,
1,3,5,1581.68,1599.96,Tyagi,Pandey,1,"Tyagi cuts this one back into Manish, who is as ever looking to move outside leg at the last minute, and cramps him for room. Tucked to square-leg"
,,,,,,,,
1,3,6,1629.24,1639.4,Tyagi,Kallis,1,threatens to move towards leg before he moves towards the off side and goes for the pull. But he too is unable to connect properly and the ball rolls towards mid-on. Good over.
,,,,,,,,
1,4,1,1714.4,1723.84,Balaji,Kallis,4,goes for the slower one and Kallis leans forward to lift it over cover point.. Easily done. The full swing of the bat.
,,,,,,,,
1,4,2,1746.88,1757.88,Balaji,Kallis,1,"ball, The beamer arrives! So does the apology from the bowler. A startled Kallis just about manages to stab it away. The ball slips out at the release"
,,,,,,,,
1,4,2,1786.2,1794.76,Balaji,Kallis,0,"length delivery around off stump, defended to the off side"
,,,,,,,,
1,4,3,1824.56,1838.36,Balaji,Kallis,4,**What a mess from Muralitharan!** Fielding lapse. Not a catch. Kallis shuffled outside off and whipped a full delivery from outside off to mid-on where Murali makes a fine mess. The ball went right through him.
,,,,,,,,
1,4,4,1875.76,1890.44,Balaji,Kallis,OUT,"is the first time that Kallis has got out in this IPL.. Stop the press. Call your grandfather. Tell your neighbor. Silence your dog. Kallis, again, shuffled right across, got outside off stump and tried to whip-flick a length delivery over the on-side field. Thin air. The ball flies through straight to crash into the middle stump."
,,,,,,,,
1,4,5,1993.52,2005.44,Balaji,Dravid,1,Bala slips in a wide down the leg side
,,,,,,,,
1,4,5,2029.64,2036.52,Balaji,Dravid,0,Big swing and a miss. It was wider outside off and Rahul went for the big off drive but couldn't reach
,,,,,,,,
1,4,6,2062.52,2074.32,Balaji,Dravid,0,"length delivery outside off and moving away slightly, Rahul tries to run it down to third man but can't connect."
,,,,,,,,
1,5,1,2122.48,2136.56,Tyagi,Pandey,2,"**just over mid-on**. It was the short delivery around off stump, Manish goes for his flat-batted heave down the ground and just about clears mid-on"
,,,,,,,,
1,5,2,2156,2168,Tyagi,Pandey,4,Top shot! Manish rocks back to get on top of the bounce of the short-of-length delivery outside off and cuts superbly to point boundary. A good horizontal-bat shot.
,,,,,,,,
1,5,3,2192.28,2206.04,Tyagi,Pandey,1,"length delivery just outside off, Manish tries to force it through the off side and edges it to short fine-leg"

,,,,,,,,
1,5,5,2296.24,2305.48,Tyagi,Dravid,1,"full delivery again, Is Dravid expecting it to be short? He was caught hanging well inside the crease and lunges out but mistimes the straight drive"

,,,,,,,,
1,6,2,2433.4,2440.16,Balaji,Dravid,0,"shortish, in the zone outside off, Dravid goes for the cut but doesn't connect. He went too hard at that shot."
,,,,,,,,
1,6,3,2464.6,2478.44,Balaji,Dravid,4,"Bosh! Full in length and around off stump, Dravid leans forward to knife through the line and on the up and the ball flies over mid-off"
,,,,,,,,
1,6,4,2502.8,2509.04,Balaji,Dravid,4,"**edged** past the diving Hayden at lone slip. It was a length delivery outside off, Dravid wanted to drive it over cover.. slightly slower in pace this one, and he edges it wide of Haydos"
,,,,,,,,
1,6,5,2539.92,2549.92,Balaji,Dravid,1,"this time he leans across, gets close to the line of the ball outside off and opens the bat-face to guide it past Hayden"
,,,,,,,,
1,6,6,2575.04,2591.96,Balaji,Pandey,4,"byes, pushes it to the pads, Manish plays the leg glance and it gets away past the diving fielder near the boundary"

,,,,,,,,
1,7,5,2803.96,2818.76,Muralitharan,Dravid,4,"Top shot! . It wasn't all that short, Dravid rocked back, created his own length and punched the off break to wide long-on boundary."
,,,,,,,,
1,7,6,2835.56,2849.48,Muralitharan,Dravid,OUT,"super comeback from Murali! It was the topspinner this time. It landed on the middle and off stump line, from round the stumps, and moved towards off stump.. Rahul again rocked back and tried to cut it but misses it completely. Timber!"
,,,,,,,,
1,8,1,2933.36,2943.4,Tyagi,Pandey,0,"bounces from short of length outside off , dabbed to point"
,,,,,,,,
1,8,2,2966.04,2971.64,Tyagi,Pandey,0,tries to clear the front foot and seemed to be initially going for the pull to the on side but the ball wasn't short as he anticipated. He tried to adjust by changing his shot and go for a cut but the ball flies past the edge
,,,,,,,,
1,8,3,2996.44,3005.52,Tyagi,Pandey,0,"**run out missed** It was pushed to midwicket and Robin had backed up too far. Hayden picked up the ball and fired the throw at the non-striker's end. Robin tried to dive back in .. Had it hit the stumps, he would have been out"

,,,,,,,,
1,8,6,3154.48,3166.2,Tyagi,Uthappa,0,"good delivery, straightening outside off stump, Robin is beaten, trying to guide it to third man. Fine spell from Tyagi, who replaced Gony for this match."

1,9,3,3385.92,3394.28,Muralitharan,Uthappa,1,"bye, appeal for lbw .. Robin goes for the big sweep and perhaps is struck just outside off stump. Got to see the replays."
,,,,,,,,
1,9,4,3409.32,3421.72,Muralitharan,Pandey,OUT,strikes again. Manish went for the big slog sweep this time and ended up slicing it towards mid-on. The ball swirled down from the night sky .. Raina went back from short midwicket and took a good catch as the ball dropped behind his shoulder.
,,,,,,,,
1,9,5,3482.32,3492.92,Muralitharan,Uthappa,0,"Robin goes for the reverse sweep, misses and is struck on the pad. Perhaps, turning down leg."

1,10,1,3577,3585.36,Morkel,Kohli,0,leans forward to push it away for a single
,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,
1,11,2,3877.08,3889.76,Muralitharan,Uthappa,2,**dropped** by R Ashwin at deep cover. RObin had switched around completely into a left-hander's stance and plays a reverse sweep - a revere slog sweep! - but Ashwin and Tyagi nearly converge and Ashwin fails to hold on.. no one called for the catch I guess
,,,,,,,,
1,11,3,3915.76,3927.84,Muralitharan,Uthappa,2,goes for another reverse sweep! this time doesn't switch around completely .. and the ball goes past short third man

1,13,5,4442.96,4451.92,Balaji,Uthappa,0,"Big swing and a miss! Full and outside off stump, Robin wanted to thrash it over the bowler but no wood on leather"
,,,,,,,,
1,13,6,4478.52,4491.36,Balaji,Uthappa,2,Top edged! Robin goes for the big pull and top edges it over the keeper. Murali runs across from third man and the ball threatens to spin away at the last minute but he stopped and lunged to his right to push it back to the field of play

,,,,,,,,
1,15,1,4699.8,4716.44,Muralitharan,Kohli,0,**Parthiv misses a stumping chance**. Kohli goes down the track but is beaten in the flight and it goes between his bat and pad and just outside leg stump.. Patel fails to collect it cleanly.
