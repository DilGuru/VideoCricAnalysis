Michael Haysman:
Here it is. The final ball. The winning delivery which was always there wasn't it. Because the game was lost a while ago.
And so the final city moment of success goes to The Royal Challengers Bangalore who have now completed three successive victories at home.
And reign high high on the log. And they deserve it. They played by far the better cricket tonight.

Sunil Gavaskar:
Indeed they have. They started slowly. They started cautiously. But Robin Uthappa. He was the pick alright. The way he smashed the Chennai Super Kings.
To take the team to that total of 171. Didnt look possible until half the stage of the Royal Challengers innings. In 10 overs they were something like 70. And in 
the next 10 overs they got a 100 runs. Full credit to Robin Uthappa for getting them there. 

Michael Haysman:
So as if this crowd hasn't made enough noise already. The fireworks add to the celebrations. All around the ground here in Bangalore. They shake hands.
And all in all it has been a thrilling evening albeit that yeah.. a slightly disappointing game at the end of the day when the victory margin is so great.
Not every game goes to the wild but that was the Super Kings answer. And it really never got going but till one when Hayden showed a little bit of agression once 
he got the mongoose out. Bailey was battling 18 from 27 deliveries which really wasn't the answer. And other than Badrinath with 31 from 17, the resistance was 
very very little.

Sunil Gavaskar:
So in the bowling, Praveen Kumar once again getting the early break through. Dale Steyn bowled like the wind was very very unlucky. Anil Kumble, very economical.
15 runs of his 4 overs. But Vinay Kumar was the one who got most of the wickets. 4 wickets for 40.

Michael Haysman:
And that's the match summary.Royal Challengers were put into bat if you remember by the Chennai Super Kings. They scored 171 for 5 courtesy of Robin Uthappa, 
68 not out of 38 deliveries. Really fantastic innings. Chennai Super Kings, as I said never got going, and finally lost the game by 36 runs. Lets go down to Andy 
Bikel.

Andy Bikel:
Well thanks Jack. I am here with Mark Boucher who is obviously an inspirational player for the Bangalore boys, but can you maintain this momentum that you have 
got going here?

Mark Boucher:
Yeah, we know that's sort of.. what is there that we don't already know about. And in the past we always been from the side that comes from behind and now we are 
at the top of the table which is good. I mean the guys have played some really good cricket. I think our bowlers have bowled very well. Our batters have batted 
really well. There is a good vibe in the field which is always good and hopefully like you said, we can keep them all riding with the momentum.

Andy Bikel:
Well i know how much you like playing 20-20 cricket. You haven't had much opportunity yet in the middle with the bat. Have you been enjoying those as well? Seeing 
your bit made up front doing well.	

Mark Boucher:
Yeah look, if I am not batting then it is good signs for our batting units because as the end it, it is them scoring runs. I'll get over it, if not today. Really 
enjoyed myself. It's about the team game. The boys are scoring runs upfront, so i'll take a backseat for now and watch espescially the guys like Jacques has been 
in fantastic form, Robin Uthappa has been in good form, Manish Pandey playing really well upfront, playing well under pressure. Things all risey at the moment. 
But things are early in the competition and we are aware of that as well.

Andy Bikel:
Well seriously great to play in front of your home crowd. Are you enjoying the pitch out there. All like the bounce in the pace in it. You must be liking it.

Mark Boucher:
I think i am sure you might probably like bowling here as well. You don't often come to india and see the ball flying past the ears. Full credits to the grounds man 
here. He has done wonders with the wickets. Its plain, awesome truth, good pace, good carry. There has been a little spin as well. All in all its a good surface 
to play 20-20 cricket on. The boundary area is small as well. So the crowd can get to see sixes as well.

Andy Bikel:
Well thank you Mark Boucher. Al the best for the rest of the tournament night and well done.

Michael Haysman:
Well there you go. I couldn't agree more about the pitch. It's been a beautiful pitch to play the game of cricket on. There is the points table at the moment.
Challengers flying high right at the top. They played 5. They have 8 points.

Michael Haysman:
Lets look now at the highlights of the Chennai Super Kings innings. Well we have got all sorts of fun at the beginning in terms of almost 2 run outs at each game.
It wasn't long before Patil was caught by Boucher for 1. And then, Hayden started getting into his stride and then after a couple of big blows with a long bat, 
he finally gets to short that out. Here it goes. And 1 over with Kallis was blistering, absolutely blistering. The super kings needed a lot more of Hayden which 
unfortunately they didn't get. This is why. Brilliant bit of fielding. He kinda knew then. I think that it was short. From there on wickets began to fall on a 
far too regular basis. Suresh raina showed some resistance with a couple of lusty blows. But it wasn't long before he sliced one to third man Kallis taking a 
nice catch there. Once again up in the air but not long enough. Caught by Morgan on the boundary. By then the game was pretty much gone albeit that a little bit 
of luck here and there. Assisted one or two more boundaries along with a misfield. Generally speaking, Royal Challengers Bangalore were feeling pretty comfortable.
Almost knew that nothing could go wrong despite the odd 6 being hit towards the end of the innings. Fancy footwork, got it nowhere, straight to back to square 
leg. Badrinath, the man suffering on this occation. Although Morkel hit a few lusty blows towards the end. It was to no avail. That was the biggest hit we have 
seen in the tournament so far. I don't know how you measure that coz it was interrupted by the roof. Just as the offstump was interrupted by the very next ball 
bowled.

Michael Haysman:
So there you go. Royal Challenger put into bat. In their 20 overs, a 171 for 5. Chennai Super Kings in reply a 135 for 7. We are gonna take a short break and we 
will be back with the presentation.

Michael Haysman:
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the presentation. My first duty is to introduce the presentation party, if I can start from my far right, its a man i am sure 
who is very happy tonight-Dr. Vijay Mallya who is the chairman of the UB group, next to him Mr.Siddharth V Mallya, director of Royal Challengers Sports Limited. 
Also Mr. Shankar Bidre, Bangalore City police commissioner, then we have Mrs. Vatsala Vatsa, IAS addition chief sectretary and chairperson of the Bangalore 
Development and then Dr. Rajmohan Rao who is the chairman of United Telecom. Welcome Ladies and gentlement. My first duty is to invite Mrs. Vatsala Vatsa to 
present the award for the DLF maximum sixes cheque and medal. That goes to Robin Uthappa of course for his 6 sixes. Robin if asked could you please come forward 
and accept the medal and also the cheque from Mrs. Vatsala Vatsa. You could please hand over the cheque and also the medal. 6 sixes of course from Robin. Put on 
a role show tonight at the end of those last 5 overs in particular. Then I would like to invite Dr. Rajmohan Rao to present the award Karbonn Kamao Catch check 
and that goes to Suresh Raina. Suresh if you could please come forward. Doctor if you could please present the cheque to Suresh Raina. That is for the best catch
of course of the match. And now I would like to ask the losing skipper to come forward. Suresh if you could please come forward for a chat? Suresh I guess you 
are quite disappointed tonight, and you were very much into this game except for the last 5 overs. 

Suresh Raina:
I think obviously Robin batted very well, but we dropped two catches of his. I think that made the difference. Yeah, but we didn't bat in between so... maybe that
cost us the game so I am looking forward to the next game. 

Michael Haysman:
Now what are the things that you have to do between now and the next game in particular?
 
Suresh Raina:
Especially batting I think if you look at the last	two games we didn't chase properly so maybe we have to think for the batting line up now, so make sure we do 
well in the next game.

Michael Haysman:
And what about the news from MS? Anything from him at all about the next game perhaps?

Suresh Raina:
I think he is coming to Bombay so lets see how he is feeling now.

Michael Haysman:
How have you found the pressure of captaincy? Have you enjoyed it? Has it been nice standing in the meantime and of course it still may continue

Suresh Raina:
I think if you look at the last three games I think we did really well against Delhi. But last game we didnt do really well. I think 20-20 cricket you cant say much.
It gives you a lot of confidence if you do well. You have to also back yourself when you dont do well. So I think I am looking really good now.

Michael Haysman:
You have lost two in a row. How does that affect things behind the scenes?

Suresh Raina:
Yeah we didnt do well in the last two games plus I think we have to do well in the practise session now and hopefully we will do well in the next game.

Michael Haysman:
Bad luck tonight. Good luck for the future.

Suresh Raina:
Thank you very much.

Michael Haysman:
Suresh Raina of course the captain of the chennai super kings tonight, unfortunately for him they didnt get up. Now is the chance to chat with the winning skipper. 
Before the skipper comes up he will be signing the match ball for the vodafone star of the match. And he signed the ball, Anil Kumble for Aishwarya Sharan. That is a nice little memento for her.
Anil, three in a row at home. That's got to be pleasing.

Anil Kumble:
Oh yes, it is great to win at home and  in front of a full house. And a great performance by the team. I mean, Robin batted exceptionally well and then the
bowling unit. I think you know all of us bowled exceptionally well and backed it up with a fantastic performance today.

Michael Haysman:
The word fantastic comes to mind as well when you talk about this crowd support. It's extraordinary.

Anil Kumble:
Oh yes! Its great to have a full house. And I believe you know the first game in this IPL that we have had a full house in Bangalore. Really looking forward to thursday again.
It's great to win at home and you know you have the home support, Nothing like it.

Michael Haysman:
We were talking in the commentary box towards the end of the game, How many runs do you think this home crowd support might be worth on a game like this? Have 
you thought about that?

Anil Kumble:
Yeah I mean, generally you give about 20 runs per over, but yeah we were looking to defend a 150 target there. I think I am really proud about the way we played
today.

Michael Haysman:
Yeah one of the things that is definitely creeping into this tournament is more strategy from the captains.

Anil Kumble:
Yeah, I think no matter what strategy you have outside of the field, you need to execute it. I think that I am really pleased that you know the way we have been
bowling and executing the plans, its really good and hope we continue like this.

Michael Haysman:
It must be nice for you as skipper to be able to throw a couple of your balls to new bowlers.

Anil Kumble:
Oh yes! Someone like Dale Steyn bowling at 150 is really great and then to back it up with Praveen Kumar who swings the ball. They form a very great combination.
And then Kallis and Vinay. Vinay, has been exceptional with picking up wickets and so is Kallis. So its nice to have that combination.

Michael Haysman:
And dont be modest. What about the old warhorse. The second most economical return into the IPL this year.

Anil Kumble:
Yeah, its nice. You know, knowing only that you need to bowl only 4 overs. I have had a long break. So the body is pretty good. So maybe that's the reason that 
the ball is coming out nicely.

Michael Haysman:
And top of the table?

Anil Kumble:
Yeah, I dont like to look at the table. But its nice to be there.

Michael Haysman:
Terrifically well played tonight. Anil well done. 

Anil Kumble:
Thank you.

Michael Haysman:
Anil Kumble of course the victorious skipper tonight, the boys in red, The Royal Challengers, Bangalore. Its now my opportunity to announce the man of the match.
Its not going to surprise anybody at all I think. That is going to be Robin Uthappa. And he is going to get a cheque from Mr.Shankar Bidre. Mr. Shankar Bidre 
with the cheque. And also a trophy from Dr. Vijay Mallya. The trophy is well from the doctor. Two big smiles there I am sure. So the man of the match, Robin 
Uthappa for his 68 out out of 38 balls. Right out of the depth. No sizes scored in th innings until you arrived and you pumped 8 out of the ground.

Robin Uthappa:
Ah well. We just wanted to make sure that we had wickets at the end so that we could go after the bowling right at the end.

Michael Haysman:
So what was going through your mind when you knew when you came on the crease you guys were below power at that stage. What was going though your mind when you 
came out.

Robin Uthappa:
Well the wicket was a little difficult to bat on. I thought the wicket had some spongy bounce. So you know you couldn't get set and you needed to get set and 
then go after the bowling. I knew I had to give myself a little time and so I thought okay, I can bat till probably about 16th over and then go after the bowling. Everything worked accordingly.

Michael Haysman:
Did I hear you correctly? You said the wicket was a little difficult to bat on after 68 of 38 balls? 

Robin Uthappa:
Yeah. But once you get set, its easier to go after the bowling.

Michael Haysman:
You seem to have a terrific team environment going.

Robin Uthappa:
Oh yes! I think it has been phenominal. I think Anil really has brought the boys together wonderfully and the South Africans and the internationals on our side 
are phenominal and they really bring the boys together beautifully and you know we have been playing really well since the last IPL and we just hope to keep the 
momentum going.

Michael Haysman:
And what about that shoulder?

Robin Uthappa:
Ah well! I just had some pains while diving in the last over. Well I hope it should be fine soon.

Michael Haysman:
Ok now well just one thing. You are an experienced player we know that. Is there one thing that you are perhaps thinking about that can make you guys just tweak 
a little bit and improve?

Robin Uthappa:
Well probably initially in the first 6 overs, well probably get a little more singles I thought. I think that is one place where we can have room for imporovement.

Michael Haysman:
Okay its a wonderful experience. Robin well played tonight. Congratulations on the match of the match.

Robin Uthappa:
Thank you very much.

Michael Haysman:
Robin Uthappa of course, the man of the match tonight for his 68 out of 38 balls and also 6 sixes. So thats a magnificent performance from Robin. Ladies and 
gentlemen thank you for your time at the presentation party. And that concludes the presentation.

Robin Uthappa:
Thank you very much indeed Michael Haysman. And that is the end of match 18.
